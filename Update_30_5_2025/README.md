## ðŸŒ± Vegetative Traits vs Disease/Pest Parameters
| Vegetative Trait     | Potential Correlation with Disease/Pest Incidence (PDI or infestation) |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Plant height**      | Often **negatively correlated** with PDI; taller plants may indicate overall health or varietal resistance. |
| **Leaf length**       | **Mixed correlation**: longer leaves could harbor more spores or provide better aeration (depends on spacing and density). |
| **Pseudostem length** | **Possible correlation** with disease entry (esp. fungal pathogens like *Stemphylium*). Longer pseudostems may trap moisture. |
| **Number of leaves**  | Can be **positively correlated** with thrips infestation (more surface area) but may also be a sign of vigor and resistance. |
| **Pseudostem width**  | Generally, **negative correlation** with disease severity; thicker pseudostems may indicate robustness. |
| **Leaf width**        | Can influence microclimateâ€”**wider leaves** may retain moisture and increase disease severity in humid conditions. |

## ðŸ¦  Disease/Pest Incidence (PDI)

### **PDI Stemphylium blight (*Stemphylium vesicarium*)**
- Favored by **dense canopy** and **high humidity**.
- Can correlate with **leaf length/width** and **plant density**.

### **PDI Purple blotch (*Alternaria porri*)**
- Tends to affect **older/lower leaves**; plants with **more leaves** may show more symptoms.
- **Nutrient-deficient** or **stressed plants** show higher severity.

### **PDI Anthrax nose (*Colletotrichum* spp.)**
- Entry through **wounds** and **pseudostem**; **length/width of pseudostem** could influence susceptibility.
- Often seen in **late-season crops**.

### **Thrips (*Thrips tabaci*)**
- Prefer **narrow, upright leaves** and **younger tissues**.
- **Number of leaves** and **leaf compactness** can be **positively correlated** with infestation.
