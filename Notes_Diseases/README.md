 ### ðŸŒ¿ How Each Index Helps
1. NDVI
- Good baseline for disease stress monitoring.
- Disease lesions and Thrips feeding reduce chlorophyll â†’ lower NDVI.

2. NDRE
- Detects stress before symptoms become visible.
- Sensitive to early pathogen activity in lower canopy.

3. GNDVI
- Responds to subtle chlorophyll degradation.
- Better than NDVI for dense onion canopies.

4. CI-RE
- Uses Red Edge, ideal for chlorosis caused by fungal infection.
- Stemphylium blight and Anthracnose lead to high variation in chlorophyll.

5. VARI
- Helpful when using just RGB bands.
- Thrips, which cause silvering and green loss, are captured well here.

6. EVI2
- Reduces background noise, useful in dense fields or mixed vegetation areas.
- Tracks stress severity progression over time.

### ðŸŒ¿ **Vegetation Indices and Their Applications**

| **Vegetation Index** | **Formula** | **Application in Disease Detection** |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) | (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red) | General indicator of plant health; useful for detecting overall stress caused by diseases like Stemphylium blight and Anthracnose. |
| **GNDVI** (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) | (NIR - Green) / (NIR + Green) | More sensitive to chlorophyll concentration; effective in early detection of diseases such as Purple blotch. |
| **NDRE** (Normalized Difference Red Edge Index) | (NIR - Red Edge) / (NIR + Red Edge) | Detects subtle changes in chlorophyll content; useful for identifying early stress symptoms before they become visible. |
| **MCARI** (Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index) | [(R700 - R670) - 0.2*(R700 - R550)] * (R700 / R670) | Targets chlorophyll degradation; effective for detecting fungal diseases. |
| **VARI** (Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index) | (Green - Red) / (Green + Red - Blue) | Detects greenness from RGB only; useful for identifying Thrips infestation and general greenness. |
