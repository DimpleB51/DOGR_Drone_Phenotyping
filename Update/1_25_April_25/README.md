### Table indices calculation
| **Index** | **Formula** | **Best For** | **Sensitivity** | **Growth Stage Suitability** | **Notes on Onion Suitability** |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **NDVI** | (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red) | General biomass, vigor | Saturates in dense canopy | Early to mid-stage | May saturate in late stages; useful for early vigor detection |
| **GNDVI** | (NIR - Green)/(NIR + Green) | Chlorophyll/nitrogen status | More sensitive than NDVI | Mid to late | More responsive to nitrogen changes; good for assessing green-leaf density |
| **NDRE** | (NIR - RedEdge)/(NIR + RedEdge) | Chlorophyll, nitrogen, late-stage crops | High (deep canopy) | Mid to late | Very effective for late-stage onions and nutrient stress detection |
| **LAI** | Empirical (e.g. from EVI) | Leaf area, yield modeling | High (biophysical) | All stages (calibration needed) | Good for modeling growth, but needs calibration; may underestimate due to onionâ€™s narrow leaves |
| **NORM2** | (Red - Green)/(Red + Green) or L2 norm of bands | General vegetation detection | Low to moderate | Early detection | Fast, simple; works when NIR is unavailable (e.g. RGB UAVs) |

### ðŸŒ¿ Vegetative Growth Parameters
| **Parameter**         | **Meaning / Importance**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Plant height**      | Total height of the onion plant from base to leaf tip. Correlates with vigor and biomass.|
| **Leaf length**       | Length of the leaves; longer leaves often contribute to better photosynthetic capacity.   |
| **Psudostem Length**  | Length of the pseudo-stem (formed by overlapping leaf sheaths); can influence bulb support and disease susceptibility. |
| **Number of leaves**  | Indicates vegetative development; more leaves generally imply greater energy capture and bulb potential. |
| **Psudostem width**   | Girth of the pseudo-stem; reflects structural robustness and possible precursor to bulb girth. |
| **Leaf width**        | Indicates leaf area; used to estimate photosynthetic potential. Wider leaves often suggest better plant health. |

### ðŸ¦  Disease Indicators (PDI = Percent Disease Index)
| **Disease**             | **Meaning / Pathogen**                | **Impact**                                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **PDI Stemphylium Blight** | Infection severity from *Stemphylium vesicarium* | Reduces photosynthesis and leaf area         |
| **PDI Purple blotch**    | Caused by *Alternaria porri*          | Leads to necrotic lesions, stunted growth    |
| **PDI AN**               | Likely *Anthracnose* disease index    | Causes leaf damage and affects bulb size and weight |
